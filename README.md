# 1 Very Practical (Almost) Whole Food Vegan Cookbook/Guide

## 1.1 What is This?

This is the collection of recipes that I use on a day-to-day basis. This short guide serves as a **recommendation** for a painless translation from standard omnivorous diet to a plant based one. Recommendation as in: _here is a meal plan which you can start using right away_.

Please fork this repo if you find any mistakes, or submit an issue (you have to have a github account for that). If you find any issues in my claims please provide adequate evidence. At this stage, this guide (or rather part of it) was created in a hurry in one evening, so I will try to add references when I have time. I am no expert so expect mistakes, and take **every** statement with a grin of salt. Or few grains of salt. Or several kilograms of salt. Also, if you don't want to make an account to submit an issue, you can contact me using email. My email can be found at the footer of my [blog](https://petargitnik.github.io/).

**Keep in mind:** I am not a health expert. So consult with your dietician and/or your doctor. Any advice you use from this guide you are using **at your own** risk.

**One more thing:** This is not a gluten free cookbook.

**Second one more thing:** All measures are approximate.

## 1.2 How do I Eat in a Day?

| A day | Meal |
| ---- | ---- |
| Breakfast | Cereals |
| Lunch | Legumes, lentils, pasta, pizza |
| Dinner | Sandwiches |
| Snack | Fruits, nuts, seeds |

If I feel especially hungry I eat dinner two times.

## 1.2 How do I Eat in a Week?

Here's a sample plan. Note that this is one variation concerning lunch. You can switch whatever lunch you want. I will give precise measures for each meal, so you don't have to worry about how much of every stuff you can use. Generally, I cook only for myself, so each batch of lunch I make lasts usually for three days. Note that split peas stands for split pea soup also called peas pudding.

| | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Breakfast | Cereals | Cereals | Cereals | Cereals | Cereals | Cereals | Cereals |
| Lunch | Cooked beans | Cooked beans | Cooked beans | Split peas | Split peas | Split peas | Pizza |
| Dinner | Sandwiches | Sandwiches | Sandwiches | Sandwiches | Sandwiches | Sandwiches | Sandwiches |
| Snack | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds | Fruits, nuts, seeds |

## 1.3 Additional considerations

### Isn't being a vegan expensive?

It is. Only if you want it to be. Generally it can be very cheap. Beans, lentils, and such are very cheap when bought in bulk. Bread is cheap too. And the textured vegetable protein (TVP) is also very very cheap.

### What the hell is TVP?

In a nutshell, that's a processed soy product. See more about it on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textured_vegetable_protein). TVP comes in many forms that I will probably mention throughout this guide. Namely:

* Soya steak
* Soya chunks
* Soya granules

It is very cheap, but tastes like crap on its own. You have to spice it up, literally.

### But wait! Soy will give me moobs and cancer!

No. It wont. There are no conclusive evidence for either of those claims. Soy is generally very healthy and a good source of proteins. Read the whole [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean) article on soybeans.

### Whait a minute, bread? White bread? Why should I eat that garbage?

No. It's not garbage. Proteins from white bread are better absorbed than, for example, proteins from whole wheat bread. Admittedly it has lower micronutrient content, but the whole what bread (and similar bread of the whole cereal variety) comes with their own baggage. Namely, antinutrients that reduce absorption of micronutrients.

### What bread should I eat then?

Any bread you like. Whole grain bread, black bread, white bread, and yes even the bread made of gluten. Unless you have coeliac disease. Then you probably already know that you have to avoid gluten.

### Will I lose weight?

Keep track of your caloric intake, and you wonâ€™t lose weight. This guide is not about a diet (as in losing weight) but about _diet_ (as in what you eat on a day-to-day basis). Change your mindset to making _healthy eating habits_.

### What beverages are OK?

I drink water, teas, and coffee. Also, soy coffee made from [kinako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinako) is pretty neat.

### OK, OK, I know this guide is not about loosing weight. But what if I want to do that?

If you have normal ranging BMI, I would not recommend diet. But if you're overweight or obese, keep track of your caloric intake by measuring everything you eat and keeping a foot diary. Use application such as [cron-o-meter](https://cronometer.com/#diary) for that. It's pretty neat and free too! Also, I'm not a dietician, as I have made a disclaimer already, but lose moderate amount of calories per day. Don't go too hard. Do yourself a favor and read [Nutrition: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.oupjapan.co.jp/en/products/detail/8984). In there, the author explained the limit to how much you can lose weight per week. It's about 2.5kg/week. Consult your dietician and/or your doctor concerning the diet. But generally, don't eat less calories than your [RMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_metabolic_rate) i.e. [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate).

### What about PROTEIN??? Vegans don't get enough protein, I've heard that in my gym...

Stop. Please stop listening to people and read, read, read. There is more than enough protein in the vegan diet. Broccoli is full of protein. TVP also. And legumes too. There is grain of truth to this claim though: the absorption of plant protein is less than protein from animals. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_value) link. But if you eat enough food, you'll get enough of the nutrients. So I wouldn't worry too much about bioavailability of protein.

# 2 Recipes yay! \^\_\^

## 2.1 Breakfast

### Cereals

Basic ingredients:

* Any type of cereal flakes that you like - 70g
* Any type of plant based milk you like - 200g
* One banana, peeled - 100g

Optional/additional ingredients (use as much as you like of any ingredient, but I will list here how much I put of each one):

* Wheat germ, crude - 40g
* Flax seeds, ground - 20g
* Coconut, shredded, dry (don't overdo it though, it's full of saturated fat, and it's bad for your health! But delicious!) - 5g
* Cocoa, unsweetened - 15g
* Carob, ground or powder - 30g
* Cinnamon - 5 - 8g
* Raisins - 5 - 10g

Instructions:

There are several ways you can go about this. You can cook cereals or soak them. I'm lazy so I soak them for 30min and then add rest of the ingredients. You can use any ingredient listed above in any combination. Sometimes I just put several of them, sometimes I go nuts and put all of them. Experience and find what you like most. Also, you don't have to use a banana, use any fruit you like. Peaches are cool too.

If you judge that the mass is a bit too dry, add more milk or water. I usually add more water, because plant based milks are too expensive from where I'm from. Also, I usually buy soy milk which lasts 5 days (note that not all soy milks last that long, but the brand I'm buying do last that much), so I use around 200g of milk a day.

## 2.2 Lunch

### Boiled Beans

### Split Pea Soup

### Vegan Patties

### Vegan Pizza

### Soy in Tomato Sauce

### Vegan pasta

## 2.3 Dinner

### Sandwiches

Basic ingredients:

* Four slices of bread - 100g
* Peanut butter or tahini - 30g

Optional/additional ingredients:

* Tomato slices - As much as you want
* Whole tomatoes - As much as you want
* Radishes - As much as you want
* Lettuce (any kind of lettuce that you like) - As much as you want (I usually use 25g)
* [Ajvar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajvar) - 25g
* Vegan mayonnaise (they usually have half the calorie content of non-vegan mayo, and have far less saturated fats, read the nutrition table on the product of your choice thought. Always!) - 25g
* Sour pickles - 30 - 50g
* On rare occasion: vegan cheese (not too often though, they can have high saturated fat content!) - two thin to medium slices
* Peppers/Paprikas - As much as you want

Instructions:

You don't really need an instruction about making sandwiches. Do you?

## 2.4 Miscellaneous

### Peanut Butter

Ingredients:

* Peanuts - 300g
* Refined sunflower oil - 8 - 20g

Instructions:

Put peanuts in a food processor, and let the food processer grind them into a fine paste. If the food processer is not powerful enough, add oil. You can use and vegetable oil. Refined or virgin, it's all ok. Keep in mind that refined oils don't have any particular taste. But virgin oils do, so they can add to taste. Whether you like that addition or not, it's up to you.
